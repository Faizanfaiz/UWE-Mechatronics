# Assembly
This document shows the assembly process for the [robot leg](#robot-leg) and [frame](#frame). Ensure that you have all the [hardware](https://github.com/Faizanfaiz/UWE-Mechatronics/blob/main/Parts/README.md#hardware) and [3D-prints](https://github.com/Faizanfaiz/UWE-Mechatronics/blob/main/Parts/README.md#3d-prints) from the [Parts](https://github.com/Faizanfaiz/UWE-Mechatronics/tree/main/Parts#parts-list) list.

# Robot leg

## Lower leg

## Upper leg

### Step 1
Use 3 M4x8 cap bolts to connect the coupler to the upper leg motor. Ensure that the pins on the motor hub are seated properly.

### Step 2
>[!NOTE]
>screwing in these bolts are slighlty harder as there isnt a big gap between the screw and the upper leg motor, I would recommend finding a allen key that has a short side or cutting one down.

Use 8 M4x8 cap bolts to secure the lower leg motor to the coupler.

### Check
After completing step 1 and 2, the assembly should look like this:

### Step 3
Use 7 M4x8 cap bolts to mount the upper leg back to the lower leg motor.
