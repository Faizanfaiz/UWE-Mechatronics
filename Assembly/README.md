# Assembly
This document shows the assembly process for the [robot leg](#robot-leg) and [frame](#frame). Ensure that you have all the [hardware](https://github.com/Faizanfaiz/UWE-Mechatronics/blob/main/Parts/README.md#hardware) and [3D-prints](https://github.com/Faizanfaiz/UWE-Mechatronics/blob/main/Parts/README.md#3d-prints) from the [Parts](https://github.com/Faizanfaiz/UWE-Mechatronics/tree/main/Parts#parts-list) list.

>[!NOTE]
>Please note that previously put together components may be excluded from other images to simplify the viewing of the step. Ensure you compare your build to the checks along the way.

# Robot leg
>[!IMPORTANT]
>Before starting the assembly on the legs, make sure you heat press the M4 threaded inserts into the holes labeled below. [Here](https://youtu.be/P7nHyI1TwKY?t=188&si=k5AsJouK1HimsCW4) is a video explaining how to do this.

## Lower leg

### Step 1
Friction press your 22x8x7mm bearings into the lower leg driven pulley.

### Step 2
Use 6 M4x16 cap bolts to connect the front and back plates of the lower leg. Once screwed together you can place the belt between the two sides and then slide the driven pulley in between both sides and align the screw holes with the leg (on the right), then use 8 M4x10 countersunk bolts, 4 on each side, to secure the pulley.

### Check
The lower leg should now look like this:

## Upper leg

### Step 1
Use 3 M4x8 cap bolts to connect the coupler to the upper leg motor. Ensure that the pins on the motor hub are seated properly.

### Step 2
>[!NOTE]
>Screwing in these bolts are slighlty harder as there isn't a big gap between the screw and the upper leg motor, I would recommend finding a allen key that has a short side or cutting one down.

Use 8 M4x8 cap bolts to secure the lower leg motor to the coupler.

### Check
After completing step 1 and 2, the assembly should look like this:  
<img src="https://github.com/Faizanfaiz/UWE-Mechatronics/blob/85827c12655045a3ead0e936a9d19bb89b890c95/Assembly/images/coupler-verify.png" width=50%>  

### Step 3
Use 7 M4x8 cap bolts to mount the upper leg back to the lower leg motor.

### Step 4
Place the driver pulley and adapteder onto the lower leg motor and screw tight using 3 M4x30 pan head bolts.

### Step 5
Push fit 4 12x8x3.5mm bearings into each tension pin.

### Step 6
Align the tension pins, pulley pin and lower leg onto the upper back leg like in the photo.
<img src="https://github.com/Faizanfaiz/UWE-Mechatronics/blob/main/Assembly/images/upper%20and%20lower%20step%201.png" width=50%>

### Step 7
Finally place the upper front leg onto the upper back leg. Screw the two havles together using the 8 M4x20 cap bolts, then use 2 M5x35 pan head bolts for the tension pins, and 1 M4x30 cap bolt for the pulley pin.

## Check
Now the robot leg should be assembled and should look like this.
